Business Applications of Variational Quantum Eigensolver: implementation for small molecules

•	Problem definition: Although in the recent years there has been a huge progress towards quantum computers, one should seemingly wait for another decade to purchase a quantum computer from the market. Nevertheless, quantum computational tools and algorithm has already been employed in different real-world problems, e.g. the Variation Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in computational physics, chemistry and material science as well as in finance.
